## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Notes

### Getting Started
1. Set up Supabase project and configure environment variables
2. Implement authentication as the foundation for all user features
3. Replace mock data services with real database operations
4. Add comprehensive error handling throughout the app

### Architecture Decisions
- Keep services modular and testable
- Use TypeScript for better code quality and developer experience
- Implement proper state management (Context API or Redux Toolkit)
- Follow React Native best practices for performance

### Database Schema (TODO: Create migration files)
```sql
-- Users table (handled by Supabase Auth)
-- Additional user profile data
CREATE TABLE user_profiles (
  id UUID REFERENCES auth.users PRIMARY KEY,
  display_name TEXT,
  learning_goal TEXT,
  experience_level TEXT CHECK (experience_level IN ('beginner', 'intermediate', 'advanced')),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Lessons table  
CREATE TABLE lessons (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  example_code TEXT,
  difficulty TEXT CHECK (difficulty IN ('beginner', 'intermediate', 'advanced')),
  order_index INTEGER NOT NULL,
  estimated_time INTEGER, -- in minutes
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- User progress table
CREATE TABLE user_progress (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users NOT NULL,
  lesson_id UUID REFERENCES lessons NOT NULL,
  completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  score INTEGER CHECK (score >= 0 AND score <= 100),
  time_spent INTEGER DEFAULT 0, -- in minutes
  completed_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, lesson_id)
);
```

### Key Performance Metrics to Track
- Daily/Weekly/Monthly Active Users
- Lesson completion rates
- Time spent per lesson
- User retention (1-day, 7-day, 30-day)
- Feature adoption rates
- Code execution success rates
- User progression through difficulty levels

Remember: Focus on user value first, technical perfection second. Ship early, iterate based on user feedback, and maintain high code quality standards throughout development.
